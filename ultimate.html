							<h1>What is ultimate</h1>
							<p>Ultimate is a non-contact, self-refereed team sport played with a flying disc frisbee. The aim of the game-Two teams of seven players 
							compete on a playing field about the same length as a football field, but narrower. At each end of the playing field there is an end zone.  
							Each team defends one end zone. They score a goal if one of their players catches the disc in the opposite end zone. The player with the 
							disc is called the thrower. The thrower may not run with the disc. Instead they move the disc by passing to team-mates in any direction. 
							The defensive team gets possession of the disc if an offensive team’s throw is not caught by a player of the same team. Then the defensive 
							team becomes the offensive team and can try to score in the opposite end zone.</p>

							<h3>Spirit of the Game</h3>
							<p>Ultimate relies upon a Spirit of the Game that places the responsibility for fair play on every player. There are no referees; the players 
							are solely responsible for following and enforcing the rules, even at World Championship level. Competitive play is encouraged, but never at 
							the expense of respect between players, adherence to the rules, and the basic joy of play.</p>

							<h3>How to Play Ultimate</h3>
							The main objective is to catch the disc in the end-zone by passing the disc to progress up the pitch.
							<ul>
								<li>You cannot walk or run with the disc.</li>
								<li>Points are scored when the disc is caught inside the end-zone.</li>
								<li>If the disc hits the ground, regardless of who touches it last, the other team gain possession.</li>
								<li>The disc can also be intercepted or caught outside the pitch to cause a turnover of possession.</li>
								<li>The teams change ends after each point.</li>
								<li>Play resumes by the scoring team from the previous point ‘pulling’ the disc to their opposition.</li>
								<li>Unlimited rolling substitutions can be made at the end of each point.</li>
							</ul>
